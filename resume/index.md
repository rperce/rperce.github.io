I'm currently a third-year student at UT Austin studying for two degrees: a BS in
Computer Science in the Turing Scholors honor program and a BS in Mathematics. I'm
expected to graduate in May 2017, and my current cumulative GPA is 3.2.

At UT, my Computer Science classes thus far include:

- Honors Theory of Programming Languages (Currently Enrolled)
- Honors Computer Vision and Machine Learning (Currently Enrolled)
- Honors Artifical Intelligence
- Honors Algorithms and Complexity
- Honors Operating Systems
- Honors Computer Structures and Architecture
- Honors Data Structures (Java)

In-depth information about education, and including high school and earlier can be found
on [this](../education/) page.


{% include h3.html title="Experience" %}

I'm slated to intern at Indeed as a sysadmin intern in the summer of 2015.
In the summer of 2015 I worked as a sysadmin intern at Indeed in Austin. I worked in a
roughly devops position from within the Operations team, improving and developing tools to
aid diagnosis of failed, failing, or otherwise problematic services and systems.

In the summer of 2014 I worked as a Software Development Intern at Qualcomm in San Diego.
I worked on a cross-platform mobile alerts app, deployed through
[Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org). The backend server was in
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org), with a
[MSSQL](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) database, and
communicated with the clients though [Socket.io](http://socket.io).

In 2013 as a freelance programmer I improved Google Calendar syncing and helped re-theme
the website for the Learn to Be Foundation, an online tutoring nonprofit. Most of the work
was in JavaScript with a bit of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

**Comfortable**: Java, Python, Ruby, Bash, Lua, LaTeX, C, CSS3, HTML5<br />
**Basic Experience**: C++, Haskell, Lisp, x86 Assembly, vimscript<br />
Very comfortable with GNU/Linux systems and git.


{% include h3.html title="Awards" %}

In 2015, I was part of the team that won Google Games Austin; the same team participated
in (TODO) the Microsoft College Puzzle Challenge and placed (TODO). MSFT3C. ACM.

In 2013, I was awarded the Parrish Computer Science Scholarship, awarded by [Don
Parrish](http://donparrish.com/ParrishCSScholarship.html) "each year to an outstanding
[incoming freshman] in the Turing Scholars Program". Also that year I received the
National AP Scholar award, "granted to students in the United States who receive an
average score of at least 4 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 4 or higher on eight or
more".

In high school, I participated in several programming competitions: I attended HP Code
Wars in 2010, 2011, and 2012; Trinity Programming Competition in 2010 and 2012; and UIL
Computer Science in 2010, 2011, and 2012. I was team captain at all of the above. This
culminated in 2013, receiving 11<sup>th</sup> place at UIL State Computer Science, after
receiving 1<sup>st</sup> at Region and 3<sup>rd</sup> at District.
