my projects, be they listed here or not.



{% include h3.html title="pomodoro-awm" %}
* Pomodoro timer widget for the [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) window manager. Only
  tested with awesome 3.5. Features include easily configurable times and colors, pausing,
  and auto-pausing after breaks (configurable). Images and more description in the README
  on GitHub: [[source]](https://github.com/rperce/pomodoro-awm)

{% include h3.html title="replacer" %}
* Few-frills templating engine for any file you care about. I wanted to use basically
  [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) but without the web context for some school
  projects, but coudln't find such a thing, so I made it. It's not fancy, but it serves my
  purposes. [[source]](https://github.com/rperce/replacer)

{% include h3.html title="slack-batch" %}
* Live [here](//rperce.net/slack-batch). Bulk file management for your slack group.
  Currently requires an [API key](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens) instead of
  using OAuth 2 tokens. Documentation minimal---I created it when my team on a free
  plan ran out of file space and we didn't want to manually delete old files---and haven't
  updated it since we fixed that problem: but if there's interest, I'll update it.

{% include h3.html title="ASCII semaphore" %}
* Live [here](//rperce.net/semaphore). Born out of a prolonged discussion on IRC, simple
  plaintext-to-ASCII-art-semaphore-and-back converter. Powered almost a full hour of
  shenanigans! [[source]](https://github.com/rperce/semaphore)

{% include h3.html title="ccbutton" %}
* Button-creating API for [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/). I used to play
  a bunch of Minecraft and, being a programmer, ComputerCraft was among my favorite mods.
  I used their in-game screens for automation controls, so I had to make a lot of buttons
  ---so I made a button API offline that I could just plop in each world to use. Features
  and usage explained on the GitHub page: [[source]](https://github.com/rperce/ccbutton)

{% include h3.html title="brainbang" %}
* A variant on the [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) esoteric
  programming language; adds named chunks of code, so you can define, e.g., !5!+++++!,
  and then use it like :5:. More details are in
  [stdlib.bb](https://github.com/rperce/brainbang/blob/master/stdlib.bb) in the GitHub
  repository: [[source]](https://github.com/rperce/brainbang)
