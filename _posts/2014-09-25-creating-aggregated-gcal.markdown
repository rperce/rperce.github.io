title: Creating Aggregated Google Calendar Views
---
*Pictoral instructions coming soon*

1. Load [http://calendar.google.com/](calendar.google.com)
2. Click dropdown arrow next to `My calendars`
3. Click `Settings`
4. Click the *title* of one of the calendars you want to share
5. In the `Embed This Calendar` row, below `Paste this code into your website`,
   click `Customize the color, size, and other options`
6. I find it most useful with `Default View` set to `Week`.
7. Check all the calendars you want to display
8. Extract the URL from the iframe in the copy-pastable HTML at the top of the
   page and make a bit.ly or similar shortened URL or put the iframe in a
   webpage of your choice
9. Repeat steps 1-3.
10. For each calendar you checked to show on the aggregated view:
    1. Click `Shared: Edit settings`
    2. Check `Make this calendar public`
    3. If you like, check `Share only my free/busy information`
11. Done!
