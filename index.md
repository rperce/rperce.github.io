I'm an Honors Computer Science and Mathematics major at the University of Texas at Austin.
I also do archery, fencing, and juggling. I read a lot of books and do a lot of
programming. See my [Projects](projects/) page for my public code or read on for my
resume.

{% include h3.html title="Education" %}

I'm currently a second-year student at UT Austin studying for two degrees: a BS in
Computer Science in the Turing Scholors honor program and a BS in Mathematics. I'm
expected to graduate in May 2017, and my current cumulative GPA is 3.2.

At UT, my Computer Science classes thus far include:

- Honors Artifical Intelligence (Currently Enrolled)
- Honors Algorithms and Complexity (Currently Enrolled)
- Honors Operating Systems
- Honors Computer Structures and Architecture
- Honors Data Structres (Java)

I went to high school from 10<sup>th</sup> grade on at Sandra Day O'Connor in San Antonio,
and my freshman year at Kadena High School on Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, Japan.


{% include h3.html title="Experience" %}

I'm slated to intern at Indeed as a sysadmin intern in the summer of 2015.

In the summer of 2014 I worked as a Software Development Intern at Qualcomm in San Diego.
I worked on a cross-platform mobile alerts app, deployed through
[Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org). The backend server was in
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org), with a
[MSSQL](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) database, and
communicated with the clients though [Socket.io](http://socket.io).

In 2013 as a freelance programmer I improved Google Calendar syncing and helped re-theme
the website for the Learn to Be Foundation, an online tutoring nonprofit. Most of the work
was in JavaScript with a bit of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).


{% include h3.html title="Languages and Environments" %}

**Fluent**: Java<br />
**Comfortable**: Ruby, Bash, Lua, LaTeX, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, C<br />
**Basic Experience**: C++, Python, Haskell, Lisp, x86 Assembly, Clojure<br />
Very comfortable with GNU/Linux system, Eclipse, vim, and git.

More in-depth, in Java I rarely have to consult documentation or a syntax cheat-sheet to
produce the code I want. For the "Comfortable" languages, I prefer to have a syntax and
common features cheat-sheet ("Wait, does `==` work with pattern matching in bash under `[[
]]` or `[ ]`? Does Ruby use `.find()` or `.index()` for array lookup?") and sometimes have
to consult documentation for function or compiler behavior. For the "Basic Experience"
languages, I either need a cheat-sheet or a lot of Googling, and often need to consult
documentation---but can do and have done projects in those languages.


{% include h3.html title="Awards" %}

In 2013, I was awarded the Parrish Computer Science Scholarship, awarded by [Don
Parrish](http://donparrish.com/ParrishCSScholarship.html) "each year to an outstanding
[incoming freshman] in the Turing Scholars Program". Also that year I received the
National AP Scholar award, "granted to students in the United States who receive an
average score of at least 4 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 4 or higher on eight or
more".

In terms of programming competitions during high school, I attended HP Code Wars in 2010,
2011, and 2012; Trinity Programming Competition in 2010 and 2012; and UIL Computer Science
in 2010, 2011, and 2012. I was team captain at all of the above. This culminated in 2013,
receiving 11<sup>th</sup> place at UIL State Computer Science, after receiving
1<sup>st</sup> at Region and 3<sup>rd</sup> at District.
