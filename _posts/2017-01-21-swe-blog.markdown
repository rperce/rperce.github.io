For CS373: Software Engineering at UT Austin, we're keeping a weekly blog talking about
our experiences in the class and working as an introduction into the weekly Agile
questions:

1. What did you do the past week?
2. What's blocking you?
3. What do you have planned for next week?

In addition, we're including some course impressions and helpful tips.

<ul>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.categories contains 'cs373' %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ post.url }}">Week {{ post.week }}: {{ post.title }}</a>
            {{ post.excerpt | remove: "tl;dr: "}}
        </li>
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
